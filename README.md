# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Autoencoders in Keras

Credit card fraud is more widespread than you might believe, and it’s been on the rise recently. By the end of 2022, we’ll have crossed a billion credit card users, metaphorically. However, credit card firms have been able to successfully identify and intercept these frauds with significant accuracy because of advancements in technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Simply stated, the concept is to examine a customer’s regular spending pattern, involving locating the geography of such spendings, to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The languages R or Python can be used to ingest the customer’s recent transactions as a dataset into decision trees, Artificial Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression for this project. The system’s overall accuracy would increases if additional data is fed.
